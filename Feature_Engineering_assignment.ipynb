Adam computes adaptive learning rates for each parameter using estimates of the first and second moments of the gradients.\n",

        "How it works:\n",

        "21. What is feature scaling? How does it help in Machine Learning?\n",
        "-->Feature scaling is a technique used in machine learning to normalize or standardize the range of independent variables (features) in a dataset. In many machine learning algorithms, the magnitude of the features can significantly affect the performance and accuracy of the model. Feature scaling ensures that all features are on the same scale or range.\n",
        "\n",
        "Feature scaling is particularly important for algorithms that rely on calculating distances between data points or gradients during training. These include algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Gradient Descent-based models (e.g., Linear Regression).\n",
        "\n",
        "How Does Feature Scaling Help in Machine Learning:\n",
        "\n",
        "Equal Contribution of Features: Scaling ensures that all features contribute equally to the model’s learning process. Without scaling, features with larger values will dominate the model, which may lead to biased predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Improves Algorithm Performance: Many machine learning algorithms work better and faster when the features are on the same scale. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Distance-based algorithms like KNN, SVM, and K-means clustering depend on measuring distances between data points. If one feature has a much larger scale than others, it can skew the distance calculation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Gradient-based algorithms like Linear Regression or Logistic Regression use optimization techniques (e.g., gradient descent) to minimize the error. Feature scaling ensures that the gradient descent converges faster and more efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "Prevents Numerical Instability: Some algorithms, like Neural Networks, are sensitive to features that are on vastly different scales. Feature scaling helps avoid numerical instability during training.\n",
        "\n",
        "Faster Convergence: For optimization algorithms (like Gradient Descent), feature scaling can speed up the convergence of the algorithm, making the training process faster and more efficient.\n",

        "--> Data encoding in machine learning refers to the process of converting categorical (non-numeric) data into a numerical format that can be used by machine learning algorithms.
